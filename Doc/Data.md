## TOPOGRAPHICAL DATA

### Digital Elevation Model (DEM):
- Elevation range: 4 m (lowest) to 66 m (highest) above sea level
- Average elevation: ~14 m
- DEM resolution: 30 m (SRTM data)

### Slope & Elevation Differences:
- Gentle slopes in floodplain areas
- Steeper slopes in surrounding hills
- Sylhet basin is bowl-shaped → water accumulates

### Low-Lying Zones & Natural Depressions:
- Large low-lying floodplain & haor wetlands → prone to inundation
- Natural depressions in Sylhet city & surrounding upazilas

<br>

## SOIL & LAND USE DATA

### Soil Absorption Capacity:
  - Variable; floodplain soils have moderate to low infiltration (clay/silt heavy)
  - Saturation common in monsoon → absorption drops

### Impervious Surfaces:
  - Urban (Sylhet city) → lots of impervious surfaces (roads, buildings)
  - Rural areas → mostly permeable farmland & wetlands

### Land Cover Types:
  - Urban (Sylhet city), agricultural (paddy fields dominate)
  - Forested hills, wetlands/haors
  - Paddy fields cover large floodplain zones

## SYLHET JUNE MONTHLY DATA SUMMARY (2010-2024)

### 1. Rainfall Data (Input Trigger)
  - Avg monthly rainfall: ~798 mm (mean)
  - Daily peaks: 150-200 mm during heavy rains
  - Rainy days: 15–20 days in June
  - Rainfall spread: widespread, heavier in E & N upazilas (Zakiganj, Kanaighat)

### 2. Water Level & Flow Data
  - Surma River water level: 8.5 m to 13.5 m (Kanaighat, Sylhet Sadar)
  - Danger level: ~12.75 m
  - Urban drainage overwhelmed → waterlogging in Sylhet & Sunamganj
  - Peak river discharge: 2000-3000 m³/s during flood peaks

### 5. Drainage & Infrastructure Maps
  - Stormwater network: natural canals (Malni Chara, Goali Chara, Kalibari Chara)
  - No typical urban sewer system
  - Embankments & levees present but breach during heavy floods
  - Sluice gates & culverts often poorly maintained
  - Rapid urbanization ↑ impervious surfaces ↑ runoff
  - Drainage canals clogged by sediment/waste → waterlogging issues

### 6. Real-Time Observations / Social Data
  - Crowdsourced reports: knee-deep water, road flooding, inaccessible areas (2024)
  - Satellite images (UNOSAT, Sentinel 2A) confirm flood extent
  - Sensor failures reported during peak floods
