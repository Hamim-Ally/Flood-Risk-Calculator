### 🌍 Global Standard Rainfall Intensity Scale (Based on mm/hour)

| **Category**           | **Rainfall Intensity**        | **Description**                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 🌦️ **Light rain**      | 0.1 – 2.5 mm/hr               | Barely noticeable, mild drizzle       |
| 🌧️ **Moderate rain**   | 2.6 – 7.6 mm/hr               | Steady rain, gets things wet          |
| 🌩️ **Heavy rain**      | >7.6 mm/hr                    | Soaks quickly, puddles form fast      |
| ⚠️ **Very heavy rain** | >50 mm/hr *(rare)*            | Intense rainfall, flooding likely     |
| 🚨 **Extreme rain**    | >100 mm/hr *(extremely rare)* | Catastrophic rainfall, flash flooding |
  
  
### 📆 Converted to Daily Totals (Approx):
Just so you can compare to the Sylhet rainfall numbers (150–200 mm/day):

| **Hourly Rate** | **24-hour Equivalent**    |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 2.5 mm/hr       | 60 mm/day (moderate)      |
| 7.6 mm/hr       | 182 mm/day (heavy)        |
| 50 mm/hr        | 1200 mm/day (disastrous)  |
| 100 mm/hr       | 2400 mm/day (apocalyptic) |
  
  
### 🌆 Impervious Surface Levels

| **Area Type**                          | **Estimated U (Impervious Ratio)** | **Explanation**                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🏞 Forest / Wetlands / Natural land    | 0.00 – 0.10                        | Almost no concrete, mostly soil or vegetation |
| 🧑‍🌾 Rural Farmland / Villages        | 0.10 – 0.30                        | Mostly soil + fields, a few roads/buildings   |
| 🏘️ Suburban Residential (low density) | 0.30 – 0.50                        | Small houses + roads, some green spaces       |
| 🏢 Urban Residential (high density)   | 0.50 – 0.70                        | Apartments, paved roads, driveways            |
| 🏙️ City Core / Commercial Areas       | 0.70 – 0.90                        | Concrete jungle: malls, offices, wide roads   |
| 🛣️ Fully Built-Up (CBD, industrial)   | 0.90 – 1.00                        | Nearly 100% sealed: no green at all           |
  
  
### 🌱 Soil Saturation

| Condition                        | Use S value |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Dry season / little rain         | 0.2 – 0.4   |
| Normal rain, well-drained soil   | 0.5 – 0.7   |
| Recent heavy rain, poor drainage | 0.8 – 1.0   |
  
  
### 📐 3. Manual Estimation Urban Drainage
Use this rough scale:

| **Area Type**               | **Estimated U (Urban Level)** |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Forest, wetlands            | 0.0 – 0.1                     |
| Agricultural village        | 0.1 – 0.3                     |
| Mixed peri-urban            | 0.3 – 0.6                     |
| Urban neighborhood (houses) | 0.5 – 0.7                     |
| Dense city core (concrete)  | 0.8 – 1.0                     |
  
  
### 🌊 FRI Level Scale (Flood Risk Index Level)

| **FRI Value (Raw)** | **Risk Level** | **Description**                            | **Action**                    |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 0 – 10              | Low            | Rain/light, soil dry, low urbanization     | Normal conditions             |
| 10 – 30             | Moderate       | Moderate rain or soil starting to saturate | Monitor closely               |
| 30 – 60             | High           | Heavy rain, saturated soil, urban runoff   | Prepare for possible flooding |
| 60 – 100            | Severe Risk    | Catastrophic flood risk                    | Emergency response needed     |
